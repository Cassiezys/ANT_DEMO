The 5th APWeb-WAIM International Joint Conference on Web and Big Data, will be held from (TBD), 2021 in GuangZhou, China.

APWeb-WAIM 2021 will feature a number of co-located workshops that are intended to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in Web and Big Data technologies to discuss and exchangepositions on current and emergent research topics. Workshop attendants will exchange ideas andexperience, establish common ground in research areas or practical problems, and hopefully identify new opportunities for collaboration and new directions for future activity. Preference will be given to timely topics that will favor highly interactive discussions.

The APWeb-WAIM 2021 Local Organising Committee will offer logistic support for the workshops, including: registration, catering, room allocation and audio/visual needs. The supported workshops will take place on the (TBD) 2021, at the conference venue.

Workshops may vary in length, but the preference is for either a half day (3 hours), Â¾ day (4.5 hours), or a full day (6 hours). Accepted workshops will be scheduled so as to avoid conflicts with conference sessions in similar or related areas.
