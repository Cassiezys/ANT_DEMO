			<p class="pad">Data and schema in datasets experience many different kinds of change. Values are inserted, deleted or updated; rows appear and disappear; columns are added or repurposed, and so on. In such a dynamic situation, users might wonder: How many changes have there been in the recent minutes, days or years? What kind of changes were made at which points of time?  How dirty is the data?  The fact that data changed can hint at different hidden processes: a frequently crowd-updated city name may be controversial; a person whose name has been recently changed may be the target of vandalism; and so on.   To interactively explore such changes, we present our DBChEx (Database Change Explorer) prototype system. Using two real-world datasets, IMDB and Wikipedia infoboxes, we illustrate how users can gain valuable insights into data generation processes and data or schema evolution over time by a mix of serendipity and guided investigation using DBChEx.  Finally, we identify a range of technical challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize our vision of change exploration.</p>
